deploying the model using fast api 
I have  developed a model on iris daa and performed the predictions and saved the model in pickel format.
Then i uploaded the model using job lib package then created a class and defined the feature column names assigned their data types .
Then i had assigned the route name and the method as well  then i defined the function where i am returning the predictions in the json foramt in api call 
When i run the code i will be getting the url link where i have to give the name given in the route and when i copy and paste the link in postman i have to get the predictions in it .
